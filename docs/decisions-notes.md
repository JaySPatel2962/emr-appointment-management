# Design decision notes

Running notes, phase by phase, for writing `ENGINEERING_DECISIONS.md`. Each entry gives the decision, then the reason.

## Phase 0: Tooling

- **Strict TypeScript everywhere.** `strict`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` and `verbatimModuleSyntax` are on, and ESLint runs `typescript-eslint` `strictTypeChecked` with no `any` and no `@ts-ignore`. Why: nullability and shape bugs surface at compile time instead of in production. `verbatimModuleSyntax` plus `consistent-type-imports` keeps type-only imports out of the runtime code.
- **ESM with `module: NodeNext`.** Why: it is Node's native module system, and NodeNext makes TypeScript check imports exactly the way Node resolves them (explicit `.js` extensions).
- **Path alias through Node subpath imports (`#app/*` in `package.json` `imports`), not `tsconfig.paths` plus `tsc-alias`.** Why: Node resolves the alias natively at runtime, so the build never rewrites import paths. The `development` condition points at `src/*.ts` and is used by tsx, tsc and Vitest. The default condition points at `dist/*.js` for production. Dropping `tsc-alias` also removed 6 high-severity `npm audit` findings (its `braces` dependency has no fixed version) and a deprecated transitive package.
- **Versions pinned to what Node 20.19 and the linter support.** TypeScript is on 6.0 because typescript-eslint doesn't support TypeScript 7 yet. Vitest is on 4.1 because Vitest 5 requires Node 22. Node 20 has been end-of-life since April 2026, so moving to Node 22 or 24 LTS is recommended.
- **tsx for development, plain tsc for the build.** Why: tsx gives fast reloads without a bundler, and tsc output is easy to debug and needs no extra tooling.
- **Two Vitest projects: `unit` and `integration`.** Unit tests need no database. Integration tests share one mongodb-memory-server **replica set**, started once in `globalSetup`, because transactions need a replica set. Each test file gets its own randomly named database, so files run in parallel without interfering. Collections are emptied after each test and their indexes are kept. Tests never connect to Atlas.
- **LF line endings enforced** through `.gitattributes` and Prettier's `endOfLine: lf`. Why: Windows checkouts with `core.autocrlf` would otherwise fail `format:check`.
- **Secrets.** `.env` is gitignored, and `.env.example` contains placeholders only.
